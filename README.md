## 📜 Requirements Specification

### 1️⃣ **System Requirements**
- Windows 10 or later (64-bit)
- .NET 6+ runtime
- SQL Server for data storage
- Active TCP/UDP data source (e.g., simulated telemetry feed)

---

### 2️⃣ **Core Functional Requirements**

#### 🖥️ **User Interface (UI)**
- Built with **WPF** using **MVVM architecture**.
- Interactive **dashboard with real-time data visualization**.
- **Customizable telemetry panels** (e.g., drag-and-drop widgets).
- **Dark mode & theming support**.
- **Lap-by-lap data comparison** feature.

#### 📡 **Data Acquisition & Communication**
- Receive real-time telemetry data via **TCP/UDP**.
- Parse and process telemetry packets efficiently.
- Handle missing or delayed data packets gracefully.
- Store received data in a **SQL database**.
- Implement an **offline mode** to analyze past race sessions.

#### 📊 **Data Processing & Visualization**
- Display real-time telemetry metrics:
  - **Speed, RPM, tire temperatures, fuel consumption, throttle/brake usage, G-forces, etc.**
- Graph historical data trends using **LiveCharts** or **SciChart**.
- Implement real-time **alerts and warnings** for critical thresholds.

#### 🛠 **Database & Storage**
- Store telemetry data efficiently in a **SQL database**.
- Allow users to **query historical telemetry data**.
- Support **export/import of race sessions** in common formats (CSV, JSON).

#### 🔗 **Integration & Extensibility**
- Interface with **Python scripts for advanced data analysis**.
- Support **MATLAB integration for simulation tasks**.
- Provide a plugin system for extending functionality.

#### ⚙️ **Performance & Optimization**
- Use **asynchronous programming** for data acquisition and UI updates.
- Optimize database queries for **fast retrieval** of large datasets.
- Ensure **low-latency rendering** of real-time charts and graphs.

---

### 3️⃣ **Non-Functional Requirements**
#### 🚀 **Performance**
- Process **at least 100 telemetry updates per second** without lag.
- UI remains responsive even with large datasets.

#### 🔒 **Security**
- Secure **database storage** for telemetry data.
- Ensure **safe handling of network data** to prevent exploits.
- Implement **user authentication (optional feature)**.

#### 🏎️ **Usability**
- Intuitive UI for engineers and performance analysts.
- Provide tooltips and help guides for new users.
- **Minimal learning curve** for motorsport professionals.

---

### 4️⃣ **Technical Stack**
- **Frontend:** WPF, C#, .NET 6+ (MVVM)
- **Backend:** C#, SQL Server, Python (for analysis)
- **Networking:** TCP/UDP socket programming
- **Visualization:** LiveCharts/SciChart for real-time graphs
- **Data Processing:** Multithreading, Async Tasks
- **Scripting Support:** Python, MATLAB

---

### 5️⃣ **Future Enhancements**
